# Overview

I wanted to better learn a game engine and decided Unity would make a good starting point. This is the result of me following a tutorial I found online. Please check the video link, they make it very easy to follow along and recreate something similar.

The Program allows you to play 2 simple levels of an angry birds like game. In this you throw a red bird at purple monsters and if the monsters get hit they will explode and die.
